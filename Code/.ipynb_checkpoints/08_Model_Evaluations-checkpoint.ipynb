    "For all three models, there was a consistent pattern of low false negatives, and high false positives. Furthermore, when it came to true negatives and true positives, there were more of the former in all models, indicating that more crimes that did not occur were accurately predicted to not occur. When it came to predicting true positives, they were able to correctly predict ~60% of all true crime occurrences. They were also able to minimize the rate of false negatives to about 35-38%, indicating that there were a few crime instances that were not predicted to happen."

    "We can see that logistic regression performed the best in terms of least overfitting. The other two models had high training scores, but low test scores, indicating that they would not perform too well on unseen data. \n",
    "Based on these scores, we can see that each model shows good progress by beating the baseline accuracy of 93%. What the baseline score tells us is how many crimes were not predicted to occur. Our models show promising results due to the fact that they are getting a significant proportion of the positive class predictions correct. The accuracy scores suggest that all models beat the baseline by predicting less negative class observations and more positive instances of crime. This is an informative start that can tell us how easy or difficult predicting crime really is. \n",

    "As a production model, I would choose logistic regression. The fact that the model can predict a relatively high proportion of real crime events suggests promising predictive ability, and is a good start to producing a complex model that predicts crime. "

    "Due to the limitation on computing power and length of time for model fitting, the accuracy scores could not be improved at this time. With a bigger machine, we can make dramatically more layers in a neural network, and can allow the model to fit for days. This will allow for more learning ability, and would hopefully result in a higher accuracy score. For logistic regression and random forest, with more time, I hope to tune the hyperparameters so that my model could be optimized to the highest degree. This would take a lot of processing power and time, so again, having a bigger machine with more computing power would allow me to do this."

    "At this time, beat label is a proxy for true geospatial analysis. I did not produce any geospatial models, so beat label was not fully used as strong predictor variable for crime. It merely hinted at a geospatial element in the models. For future models, I would like to explore multiclassification so that I could specify a specific beat label for where a crime occurred. Furthermore, I would like to predict the type of violent crime, whether it be battery, assault, kidnapping, etc, and the time that the crime occured at. I would like to combine geospatial elements, time series elements, and types of crime so that the next model would be able to predict where a certain crime occurred at a certain time. "

    "Based on the fact that temperature was an important predictive feature, we can focus police efforts during the months that correspond to the temperature. We can also focus police efforts based on hour because hour was an important feature in our model. Using beat label, however, as a predictive feature in a model can be risky. In each model, beat label held great importance and weight when predicting the probability of crime occurring. Specifically, in logistic regression, we saw that as beat label increases, the probability of crime decreases. This can be explained by the fact that as beat label increases (from 100's to 2000's), the more north in Chicago they are located. In the [beat map](https://github.com/blisspaik/Capstone/blob/master/Visuals/Chicago_beat_areas.png), we can see that the darker shades of blue are located primarily in northern Chicago. Northern Chicago could have higher socioeconomic status in comparison to southern Chicago, suggesting that there are more policing efforts in these higher socioeconomic areas. This then goes into the ethics of where policing efforts are directed based on race, gender, etc. because features like these are highly correlated with socioeconomic status. Police predictive biases are already a huge problem in society, so it is important to crime build models\n",
